<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy Trench">
  The only prerequisite for Trench is a system that has Docker and Docker Compose installed [see installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). We recommend having at least 4GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores for optimal performance if you're running a production environment.

After installing Docker, you can start the local development server by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frigadehq/trench && cd trench/apps/trench && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Send a sample event">
    Once you've obtained your [public and private API key](/api-reference/overview), you can send a sample event to Trench as such:

    ```bash
    curl -i -X POST \
       -H "Authorization:Bearer public-d613be4e-di03-4b02-9058-70aa4j04ff28" \
       -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
       -d \
    '{
      "events": [
        {
          "userId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
          "event": "ConnectedAccount",
          "properties": {
            "totalAccounts": 4,
            "country": "Denmark"
          },
          "type": "track"
        }]
    }' \
     'https://sandbox.trench.dev/events'
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a throttled webhook">
    Use the webhooks endpoint to create a throttled webhook that will trigger based on the conditions. It leverages a Kafka consumer underneath so it will be throttled and supports batching too. Example:

    ```bash
    curl -i -X POST \
       -H "Authorization:Bearer public-d613be4e-di03-4b02-9058-70aa4j04ff28" \
       -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
       -d \
    '{
      "url": "https://your-webhook-url.com",
      "enableBatching": true,
      "eventTypes": ["ConnectedAccount"],
      "eventNames": ["*"]
    }' \
     'https://sandbox.trench.dev/webhooks'
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute raw SQL queries">
    Use the queries endpoint to analyze your data.  Example:

    ```bash
    curl -i -X POST \
       -H "Authorization:Bearer public-d613be4e-di03-4b02-9058-70aa4j04ff28" \
       -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
       -d \
    '{
      "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE userId = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'"
    }' \
     'https://sandbox.trench.dev/queries'
    ```

    Sample query result:

    ```json
    {
      "count": 5
    }
    ```

  </Step>
