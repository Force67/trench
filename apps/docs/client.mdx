## Overview

`trench-js` is a client library for both web and Node.js environments that allows you to send events to any Trench instance. This library is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your existing projects. Alternatively, you can use the CDN version.

## Installation via package manager

Install `trench-js` using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install trench-js
```

You can now initialize the client with your Trench instance URL and public API key:

```ts
import Trench from 'trench-js'

const trench = new Trench({
  serverUrl: 'your-server-url',
  publicApiKey: 'your-public-api-key',
})
```

The client is built on top of [Analytics](https://github.com/DavidWells/analytics) and supports all of its [methods](https://github.com/DavidWells/analytics#usage).

For example, you can identify a user like this:

```ts
trench.identify('user-id', {
  email: 'test@example.com',
})
```

And track an event like this:

```ts
trench.track('test-event', {
  test: 'test-value',
})
```

Or to record a trigger page view:

```ts
trench.page()
```

## Installation via CDN

Alternatively, you can use the CDN version:

<TrenchScript />

This will automatically add the `trench` object to the global scope and you can start tracking events automatically as `autoCaptureEvents` is set to `true` by default.
