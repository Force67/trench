# Trench Documentation

The content and configuration powering the Trench documentation available at [docs.trench.dev](https://docs.trench.dev)

### 👩‍💻 Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command

```
npm i mintlify -g
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where mint.json is)

```
mintlify dev
```

#### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
- Mintlify dev is updating really slowly - Run `mintlify clear` to clear the cache.
